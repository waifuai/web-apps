  <h1>EmergentEcon: Market Simulation Analysis</h1>
  
  <div class="analysis">
    <h2>Current Market State Analysis</h2>
    
    <p>Thank you for initiating the market simulation! Let's analyze the current state of our simulated market based on the snapshot you've provided.</p>

    <h3>Agent Distribution</h3>
    <div class="agent-distribution">
      <div class="agent-type">
        <div class="agent-icon" style="background-color: #e74c3c;">A</div>
        <p>Strategy A: 5 agents (50%)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="agent-type">
        <div class="agent-icon" style="background-color: #2ecc71;">B</div>
        <p>Strategy B: 1 agent (10%)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="agent-type">
        <div class="agent-icon" style="background-color: #3498db;">C</div>
        <p>Strategy C: 4 agents (40%)</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Observations</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Dominant Strategy:</strong> Currently, Strategy A is the most popular, adopted by half of the agents. This could indicate that Strategy A has been particularly successful in recent iterations.</li>
      <li><strong>Diversity:</strong> Despite the dominance of Strategy A, there's still significant diversity in the market. This suggests the system hasn't reached equilibrium yet.</li>
      <li><strong>Potential for Change:</strong> With 40% of agents using Strategy C, there's potential for a significant shift if C proves more successful in upcoming iterations.</li>
      <li><strong>Minority Strategy:</strong> Strategy B is currently the least popular. It will be interesting to see if it gets phased out or if it finds a niche that allows it to persist or even grow.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Predictions</h3>
    <p>Based on this snapshot, we can make a few predictions about how the market might evolve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the current conditions persist, we might see more agents switch to Strategy A in the short term.</li>
      <li>However, as A becomes more common, it may create opportunities for B or C to become relatively more successful.</li>
      <li>We might see oscillations between A and C dominance before any equilibrium is reached.</li>
      <li>Strategy B might either die out or find a stable minority position if it can exploit a niche in the market dynamics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Strategy Performance Over Time</h3>
    <p>To better understand the market dynamics, it would be helpful to track the prevalence of each strategy over time. Here's a hypothetical projection based on the current state:</p>

    <div class="chart">
      <canvas id="strategyChart"></canvas>
    </div>

    <script>
      const ctx = document.getElementById('strategyChart').getContext('2d');
      new Chart(ctx, {
        type: 'line',
        data: {
          labels: ['Start', 'Round 1', 'Round 2', 'Round 3', 'Round 4', 'Round 5'],
          datasets: [{
            label: 'Strategy A',
            data: [50, 55, 60, 58, 52, 48],
            borderColor: '#e74c3c',
            tension: 0.1
          }, {
            label: 'Strategy B',
            data: [10, 8, 5, 7, 10, 12],
            borderColor: '#2ecc71',
            tension: 0.1
          }, {
            label: 'Strategy C',
            data: [40, 37, 35, 35, 38, 40],
            borderColor: '#3498db',
            tension: 0.1
          }]
        },
        options: {
          responsive: true,
          scales: {
            y: {
              beginAtZero: true,
              max: 100,
              title: {
                display: true,
                text: 'Percentage of Agents'
              }
            },
            x: {
              title: {
                display: true,
                text: 'Simulation Rounds'
              }
            }
          }
        }
      });
    </script>

    <p>This chart illustrates a possible scenario where Strategy A initially gains more followers but then starts to decline as the other strategies adapt and find their niches.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The current market state presents a fascinating snapshot of a complex adaptive system in action. As the simulation progresses, we'll be able to observe how these initial conditions evolve and whether they lead to a stable equilibrium, perpetual fluctuations, or perhaps even more complex patterns of behavior.</p>

    <p>Continue running the simulation to see how these dynamics play out. Remember, in complex systems like this, small changes can sometimes lead to significant shifts in the overall behavior of the system.</p>
