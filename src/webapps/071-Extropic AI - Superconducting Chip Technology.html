    <h2>Key Features of Our Superconducting Chips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nano-fabricated Aluminum Circuits:</strong> Our chips are crafted using state-of-the-art nano-fabrication techniques with aluminum as the primary material.</li>
      <li><strong>Low-Temperature Operation:</strong> The chips operate at extremely low temperatures where they become superconducting, dramatically reducing energy loss.</li>
      <li><strong>Josephson Junctions:</strong> We utilize Josephson junctions as a source of quantum tunneling, providing the necessary nonlinearity for complex computations.</li>
      <li><strong>Passive Operation:</strong> Our chips are entirely passive, consuming energy only during state measurement or manipulation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="tech-details">
      <h3>The Science Behind Superconducting Chips</h3>
      <p>Superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where certain materials, when cooled below a critical temperature, conduct electricity with zero resistance. This property allows for the creation of highly sensitive and energy-efficient quantum circuits.</p>
      <p>Our chips leverage the Josephson effect, which occurs when two superconductors are separated by a thin non-superconducting layer. This creates a junction where Cooper pairs of electrons can tunnel through the barrier, leading to quantum behavior that we harness for computation.</p>

    <h2>Advantages Over Traditional Computing</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Our superconducting chips consume orders of magnitude less power than traditional semiconductors.</li>
      <li><strong>Speed:</strong> The quantum tunneling effect allows for extremely fast switching times, enabling rapid computations.</li>
      <li><strong>Noise Tolerance:</strong> Superconducting circuits are inherently less susceptible to thermal noise, allowing for more precise calculations.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The technology shows promise for scaling to larger, more complex systems without proportional increases in power consumption.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>Q: How cold do the chips need to be to operate?</h3>
    <p>A: Our chips typically operate at temperatures below 1 Kelvin (-272.15°C or -457.87°F). We use specialized cryogenic systems to achieve and maintain these ultra-low temperatures.</p>
    
    <h3>Q: Are these chips quantum computers?</h3>
    <p>A: While our chips leverage quantum effects, they are not quantum computers in the traditional sense. Instead, they use quantum phenomena to perform classical computations more efficiently.</p>
    
    <h3>Q: How do you plan to make this technology accessible?</h3>
    <p>A: We're developing cloud-based services that will allow businesses and researchers to access our superconducting chip technology remotely, without the need for on-premises cryogenic equipment.</p>
