        <h1>Innovative Solana ICO System: Bancor Bonding Curve &amp; Affiliate Commission</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to this tutorial on a groundbreaking Initial Coin Offering (ICO) system built on Solana. This innovative approach combines three key elements to create a fair, efficient, and sustainable token launch mechanism:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>A Bancor-style bonding curve to prevent liquidity draining bots</li>
            <li>An affiliate commission system for marketing</li>
            <li>Utilization of Solana for lower gas fees compared to Ethereum</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>1. Understanding the Bancor Bonding Curve Mechanism</h2>
        
        <p>A Bancor bonding curve is a specific type of bonding curve that uses a constant reserve ratio to determine the relationship between a token's price and its supply. In our ICO system, the price of tokens increases as more tokens are sold, following this predefined curve.</p>

        <h3>Key Benefits of the Bancor Bonding Curve:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prevents large-scale buying and immediate selling (anti-bot measure)</li>
            <li>Creates a fair distribution model with continuous liquidity</li>
            <li>Ensures price discovery and stability</li>
            <li>Incentivizes early participation without penalizing latecomers</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>How it works:</strong> As tokens are purchased, the price gradually increases. This discourages bots from buying large quantities at once, as each subsequent token becomes more expensive. The constant reserve ratio ensures that there's always liquidity in the system.
        </div>

        <div id="bancor-chart">
  <img src="https://websim.ai/bancor_bonding_curve.png" alt="Graph of a Bancor bonding curve showing token price increasing as token supply increases" width="800" height="400" style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 800px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; margin: 20px 0;">
</div>

        <script>
        function generateBancorCurve(reserveRatio, initialSupply, initialReserve) {
            let supply = [];
            let price = [];
            let currentSupply = initialSupply;
            let currentReserve = initialReserve;

            for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                supply.push(currentSupply);
                price.push(currentReserve / (currentSupply * reserveRatio));
                currentSupply *= 1.05;
                currentReserve = currentSupply * price[price.length - 1] * reserveRatio;
            }

            return { supply, price };
        }

        const { supply, price } = generateBancorCurve(0.2, 1000000, 100000);

        const trace = {
            x: supply,
            y: price,
            mode: 'lines',
            name: 'Token Price',
            line: {
                color: '#9945FF',
                width: 3
            }
        };

        const layout = {
            title: 'Bancor Bonding Curve',
            xaxis: { title: 'Token Supply' },
            yaxis: { title: 'Token Price' },
            font: { family: 'Arial, sans-serif' },
            plot_bgcolor: '#f8f8f8',
            paper_bgcolor: '#f8f8f8',
        };

        Plotly.newPlot('bancor-chart', [trace], layout);
        </script>

        <h2>2. Implementing the Affiliate Commission System</h2>

        <p>Our ICO system now incorporates an innovative affiliate commission structure to incentivize marketing and community growth.</p>

        <h3>Commission Structure:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Anyone can generate an affiliate link for the ICO</li>
            <li>When an investor purchases tokens through an affiliate link, the affiliate receives 1% of the purchase value</li>
            <li>9% of the purchase value is allocated to the project's marketing wallet</li>
            <li>The remaining 90% goes to the project's treasury or liquidity pool</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Benefit:</strong> This approach creates a decentralized marketing force, incentivizing community members to promote the project. It ensures that marketing efforts can continue post-ICO, maintaining project visibility and growth potential.
        </div>

        <h2>3. Leveraging Solana for Enhanced Efficiency</h2>

        <p>By building this ICO system on Solana, we tap into several advantages that make the token launch more accessible and user-friendly.</p>

        <h3>Advantages of Using Solana:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Significantly lower gas fees compared to Ethereum</li>
            <li>High throughput (up to 65,000 transactions per second)</li>
            <li>Fast transaction finality (400ms block times)</li>
            <li>Scalability to handle high-volume token sales without network congestion</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Note:</strong> While Solana offers these benefits, it's crucial to understand that it's a different ecosystem from Ethereum, with its own set of tools, wallets, and development practices.
        </div>

        <h2>4. How the System Works in Practice</h2>

        <p>Let's walk through a hypothetical token purchase in this new ICO system:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Affiliate Link Generation:</strong> A community member generates a unique affiliate link.</li>
            <li><strong>User Connection:</strong> An investor connects their Solana wallet to the ICO interface via the affiliate link.</li>
            <li><strong>Token Purchase:</strong> The investor decides to buy 1000 tokens.</li>
            <li><strong>Price Calculation:</strong> The system calculates the price based on the current point on the Bancor bonding curve.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Execution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>90% of the purchase amount is sent to the project's treasury</li>
                    <li>9% is allocated to the project's marketing wallet</li>
                    <li>1% is sent to the affiliate's wallet</li>
                    <li>Tokens are minted and sent to the investor's wallet</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Curve Adjustment:</strong> The bonding curve is updated, slightly increasing the price for the next purchase.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>5. Benefits for Different Stakeholders</h2>

        <h3>For Investors:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fair pricing model that rewards early participation</li>
            <li>Protection against bot manipulation and whale dominance</li>
            <li>Low transaction fees thanks to Solana's efficiency</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Project Creators:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sustainable funding model with built-in marketing budget</li>
            <li>Natural price discovery mechanism</li>
            <li>Increased token holder diversity due to bot prevention</li>
            <li>Decentralized marketing force through the affiliate system</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Affiliates:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Opportunity to earn commissions by promoting the project</li>
            <li>Aligned incentives with the project's success</li>
            <li>Easy-to-use affiliate system built on Solana's efficient infrastructure</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the Ecosystem:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Encourages fair and transparent token distributions</li>
            <li>Reduces the impact of market manipulation</li>
            <li>Promotes long-term thinking and sustainable growth</li>
            <li>Fosters community engagement through the affiliate program</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>This innovative ICO system combines the mathematical elegance of Bancor bonding curves, the community-driven approach of an affiliate system, and the efficiency of Solana to create a next-generation token launch mechanism. By addressing common issues like bot manipulation, unsustainable marketing, and high gas fees, while also incentivizing community participation, this system paves the way for fairer, more efficient, and more sustainable token ecosystems.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Future Developments:</strong> As this system gains adoption, we can expect to see variations in bonding curve models, dynamic commission rates, and integration with DeFi protocols for enhanced liquidity and staking options. The affiliate system could also evolve to include tiered rewards or governance rights for top performers.
        </div>

        <p>Remember, while this system offers numerous advantages, it's crucial for project creators, investors, and potential affiliates to conduct thorough research and consider all aspects of tokenomics and blockchain technology before participating in any ICO.</p>
